**Article Relating to a Topic I am Interested in:**    
[How Data Science Is Revolutionizing The Music Industry](https://www.opentracker.net/article/data-science-music/)  
Music has always been a passion of mine, but until recently it was restricted to listening and playing. A friend of mine is trying to get into the music industry and is studying at Berklee School of Music in Boston. I've been reading up on production and the industry so that I can keep up with him when we talk. 

**A Graph I Want to Know How to Make:**

I want to know how to make steam graphs, as they are aesthetically pleasing and it seems there is a lot of customization you can do with it as opposed to something like a bar graph or line graph. Additionally, something like this would be interesting to show the most common words in music each year. 

**2 Datasets I am Interested in Exploring**  

   | Dataset Name | Description of Data | Hypertext Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Marvel Characters | A list of Marvel Character profiles including powers, appearance, personality, backstory, and character stats. Web scraping would be useful to find characters with certain traits. Coding could be used to sort and organize characters based on stat spread, and a character web connecting characters to franchises and teams could be coded based on key words in their character profiles. | [Marvel Character Database](https://www.marvel.com/characters) |
| 19th Century American Children's Book Trade Directory | A dataset documenting activity of individual and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of children's books. Two specific ways coding might be used is finding correlative and time series trend analysises and clustering individuals and/or firms into groups based on behavior and/or characteristics. | [19th Century American Children's Book Trade Directory](https://repository.upenn.edu/entities/dataset/16705c2f-023b-495e-baf4-dee805eae59f) |
